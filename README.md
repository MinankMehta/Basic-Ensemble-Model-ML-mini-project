# Basic-Ensemble-Model-ML-mini-project
For my machine learning mini project focused on breast cancer prediction, I have implemented a fundamental ensemble model comprising three distinct classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Naive Bayes Classifier. This ensemble model combines the predictive capabilities of these individual classifiers to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness of my breast cancer prediction system. By leveraging the strengths of each of these classifiers, I aim to achieve a more reliable and accurate predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis and assessment. This ensemble approach allows me to harness the complementary strengths of these classifiers to improve the overall performance and reliability of my predictive system.
