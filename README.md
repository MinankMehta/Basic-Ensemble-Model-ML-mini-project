# Breast Cancer Prediction Ensemble Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my machine learning mini-project focused on breast cancer prediction. The project implements a fundamental ensemble model, combining three distinct classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Naive Bayes Classifier. The evaluation metrics used for assessing the model's performance include accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, specificity, and sensitivity.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of breast cancer prediction by leveraging the strengths of individual classifiers through an ensemble approach. The combination of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes aims to create a more reliable and accurate predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis and assessment.

## Features

- **Ensemble Model:**
  - Combines Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes Classifier.
  - Leverages the strengths of each classifier to improve overall accuracy and reliability.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of the predictions.
  - F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
  - Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
  - Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
  - Specificity: Proportion of true negative predictions among all actual negatives.
  - Sensitivity: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the ensemble model on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MinankMehta/Basic-Ensemble-Model-ML-mini-project.git
